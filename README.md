# NOXMFD Extension: TAC Module

[![NOXMFD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-NOXMFD-blue)](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Placeholder repo — scaffold only, registers an empty **TAC** page under
[NOXMFD](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD)'s EXT nav. See [issue #93](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD/issues/93)
for the feature this will become: a mission-control target board for a human controlling officer
coordinating targets across squadrons and individual pilots.

Built entirely through NOXMFD's public extension API — see NOXMFD's
[`EXTENSIONS.md`](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD/blob/main/EXTENSIONS.md). This repo does
**not** modify NOXMFD's own source.

## What's here

- `src/plugin/Plugin.cs` — registers the **TAC** EXT page.
- `src/plugin/TacPageAssets.cs` — embedded-resource lookup for `src/web/`'s HTML/CSS/JS.
- `src/web/tac.{html,css,js}` — the page itself, currently an empty "COMING SOON" placeholder.
- `docs/` — planning docs for the real feature (see issue #93).
- `lib/NOXMFD.dll` — compile-time reference only, not shipped to players (NOXMFD is already
  installed as its own plugin; `Private=false` in the `.csproj` keeps this project from bundling a
  second copy). Committed to this repo since it's this project's own dependency.

## Building

Requires a local Nuclear Option install with BepInEx 5 and NOXMFD already installed. Create a
gitignored `GameDir.props` next to the `.csproj` if your install isn't the default Steam path:

```xml
<Project><PropertyGroup>
  <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option</GameDir>
</PropertyGroup></Project>
```

Then:

```bash
dotnet build TacModule.csproj -c Release
```

The build's `DeployToGame` target copies the built DLL straight into
`$(GameDir)\BepInEx\plugins\` for you.

## Installing

1. Install BepInEx 5 and [NOXMFD](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD).
2. Drop `NOXMFD.TacModule.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`.
3. Launch the game — a **TAC** entry appears under NOXMFD's EXT nav.
